# Unreal.art – The AI Studio & Launchpad

Welcome to the future of AI creation, collaboration, and innovation.

---

## 🚀 The Story So Far

Unreal.art began as an ambitious AI content generation platform, powered by proprietary decentralized compute (dePin). In just a few months, we:

- Attracted 3,500+ users
- Forged partnerships and won prizes
- Gained VC attention and joined Soonami Cohort 7
- Burned through $45K of credits to learn, iterate, and grow

But we faced a choice: chase quick revenue, or build something bigger. We chose the latter.

## 🔥 The Pivot: From Platform to AI Launchpad

The world is drowning in fragmented AI tools. Startups struggle with billing, churn, user acquisition, and the ever-rising cost of compute. Users are lost in a maze of disconnected apps.

**Unreal is the answer.**

We’re evolving into an AI Launchpad and Studio—a unified space for:

- **AI startups**: Join the Unreal economy, powered by the $UNREAL token. Forget billing, churn, and infrastructure headaches. Focus on building, and let us handle the rest.
- **Users & creators**: Access a growing suite of AI tools, agents, and creative power—all in one place, with a single account and treasury-backed free generation (for now!).

## 💎 Why Unreal?

- **Tokenized Compute**: $UNREAL token powers all inference, making compute transparent, fair, and community-driven.
- **Open Ecosystem**: Any AI startup can plug in, reach users, and monetize instantly.
- **Unified Experience**: No more juggling logins or subscriptions. One studio, infinite possibilities.
- **Sponsored Inference**: While the $UNREAL treasury lasts, all generations are free for users.

## 🗓️ What’s Next?

- **July**: Pre-launch of the $UNREAL-powered OpenAI wrapper
- **Mid Next Month**: Launch of the full Unreal AI Studio
- **3,000+ new users**: Coming via Neoma Ventures, our marketing partner

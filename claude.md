1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan in .md file to tasks directory.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible and with component focus. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Comment your code as you go along, explaining what each section does and why it was implemented that way.
8. Please check through all the code you just wrote and make sure it follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front and and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited
9. Finally, add a review section to the .md file you created with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
